I’m a Software Engineer with over a decade of experience developing scalable systems across ERP, marketplace, and AI domains.
My expertise lies in backend architecture, system integration, and cloud automation using Golang, ReactJS, Docker, and Kubernetes.

Starting from instrumentation and embedded systems, I learned how to build reliable solutions from hardware-level control to enterprise-scale platforms. With an analytical and structured mindset, I focus on turning complexity into clarity through clean, maintainable, and efficient software systems.

For me, software is not just about writing code — it’s about engineering intelligence that simplifies processes and drives meaningful results.
